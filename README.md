### What I learned

- How to use ternary operator with more conditions then usual:

  ```
    setGreeting(
      time > 6 && time < 12
        ? 'Good morning gorgeous'
        : time > 12 && time < 16
        ? 'Continue to do your stuff darling'
        : time > 16 && time < 21
        ? 'Good Evening stunning'
        : 'It is late, go to sleep!'
    );
  ```

  - How to use conditional styling as a variable and implement it as inline style attribute inside the HTML element.

  ```
  const style = {
    opacity: !openEyes ? 0 : 1,
  };

   <img
          src={unicornOpenEyes}
          style={style}
          className="open-eyes--img"
          alt="you woke up the unicorn, the eyes are open"
        />
  ```
